        <p>
            This project was created to understand how a real-world web app works end-to-end:
            user management, routing, form handling, template rendering, and database integration.
            It also serves as a personal portfolio piece demonstrating web development skills with Flask.

        <p>
            Hi, I'm <b>Swastik</b>, currently in my engineering 4th year. I have keen interest in technology and have hands on experience in building web applications full stack. I have expertise in Python and C++ language as I have solved coding problems in these. <br>
<br>
            <b>SKILLS:</b><br>
            Programming Languages: Python, C/C++, Java, JavaScript<br>
            Frameworks: Flask, Django<br>
            ORM: SQLAlchemy<br>
            Concepts(CS): OOP, DSA (250+ solved), DBMS, Networks, OS<br>
            Tools: Git, Postman<br>
<br>
            <b>BEING HONEST:</b>
            I started to code in my 3rd year and I sucked (maybe I still do). I spent hours every day to learn DSA, Backend, ML, etc. In this one year I haven't achieved much but solved around 280 problems (referring to solutions) and build one descent project by myself(mentioned in projects). I never got above 7 GPA until my 6th semester, where I got a 9.2. So yeah, I am hardworking, consistent and try to be excellent in what I do.

            If you are a recruiter or someone who can help me get an internship, I would LOVEEE to work.
